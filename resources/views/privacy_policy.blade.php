                <h4>3.1 We may use the collected information for the following purposes:</h4>

                <p>&#x2022; To provide and improve our services, including processing and fulfilling your ride requests.</p>
                <p>&#x2022; To personalize your experience with the App and customize the content we deliver to you.</p>

                <p>&#x2022; To comply with legal obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</p>
                <p>&#x2022; Data Sharing and Disclosure</p>
                <p>&#x2022; We use your recent phone call logs to save the rider for the future rides. (This is also the core functionality of the app, that driver can save the user whom he get a phone called and save that user in database (which is also secured).)</p>

                <h4>3.2 We may share your personal information in the following circumstances</h4>

                <p>&#x2022; Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities (e.g., court orders or government agencies).</p>
                <p>&#x2022; Business Transfers: If our company undergoes a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>
                <p>&#x2022; With Your Consent: We may share your information with third parties if you have given us your consent to do so.</p>

                <h3>Global availability</h3>
                <p>Information the author publishes on the World Wide Web may contain references or cross references to the author's products, programmes and services that are not announced or available in your country. Such references do not imply that the author intends to announce or make available such products or services in your country.</p>

                <h3>4.Usage of sensitive permissions in app</h3>
                <p>&#x2022; Call Logs - We are using this permission so the driver can easily save rider's phone number whom he was in communication over a phone call in recent times. We will never share any of these phone numbers from recent call list to any of the third party services. </p>

                <h3>5.Data deletion</h3>
                <h4>Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Taxi2000 may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for reasons stated in this policy.</h4>
                <p>Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Side navigation menu > Contact us in the Taxi2000 app. Following an account deletion request, Taxi2000 deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for the applicable statutory retention period after a deletion request. For riders and order recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.</p>

                <h3>6.Data Security</h3>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                <h3>7.Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.</p>

                <h3>8.Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the revised policy in the App or through other communication channels. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
